``dax_ppdb`` is a package in the `LSST Science Pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_.

This package provides a Python interface for the Prompt Products Database (PPDB).
Its initial version was developed primarily for performance testing of various
implementation options as a part of the ``lsst-dm/l1dbproto`` package.  Several
modules/classes were moved to this package and renamed. It is expected that
this implementation will further evolve to support features necessary for the
Alert Production Pipeline.
